## Implementation Guidelines

### View Structure Standards
1. Use consistent Blade syntax and formatting
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include proper accessibility attributes
4. Use translation helpers for all user-facing text
5. Maintain responsive design patterns

### File Organization
- Main views: `resources/views/{module}/`
- Partials: `resources/views/{module}/partials/`
- Ajax HTML: `resources/views/{module}/ajax_html/`
- Email templates: `resources/views/emails/{type}/`
- Shared partials: `resources/views/partials/`

### Testing Requirements
1. Verify view renders without errors
2. Test with various data states (empty, single, multiple)
3. Validate responsive behavior
4. Check accessibility compliance
5. Ensure proper escaping and security

## Notes
- Email template views are already complete (16/15 target exceeded)
- Focus on conversation UI and shared partials
- Maintain consistency with existing view patterns
- Consider reusability when creating new partials
